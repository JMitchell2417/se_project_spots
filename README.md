# Project 3: Spots

### Project Description

Spots is an interactive, responsive social media web application where users can manage a simple profile, add and remove photos, and like photos shared by others. The project focuses on building a flexible, scalable layout that adapts cleanly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

This project emphasizes modern CSS layout techniques, responsive design principles, and translating a Figma design into a functional, production-ready interface.

**Overview**

The primary goal of Spots was to implement a desktop-first layout based on a 1440px Figma design, then progressively adapt it to smaller screen sizes without breaking layout, spacing, or usability.

Rather than relying on fixed dimensions, the layout prioritizes flexibility using CSS Grid, Flexbox, percentage-based sizing, and media queries only where necessary.

**Tools & Technologies**

- HTML5: semantic, accessible markup

- CSS3: Flexbox, Grid, media queries

- Figma: design reference and layout planning

- Responsive Design: desktop-first with progressive adaptation

**Business Value**

- Demonstrates efficient IP address planning for growing networks.

- Improves reliability by ensuring consistent routing paths.

- Reduces troubleshooting time through clear network segmentation.

- Reflects real-world networking tasks commonly performed in help desk and NOC environments.
